# Book2Epub
## This is a collection of codes to create a epub from a pdf of scanned book. 

The resulting epub can be then read in a Kindle or other e-readers.
These codes use Tesseract to ocr the text.
I have succesfully converted Bengali pdfs to epubs.  

Some level of post processing is required to the final epub for aesthetic purposes. This can be done in epub editor like Calibre.
